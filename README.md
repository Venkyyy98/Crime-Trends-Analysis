# Crime Trends Analysis in the U.S. (NY & NJ Focused) 📊

# Overview

This project conducts a statistical analysis of crime trends in the U.S., with a focus on New York and New Jersey. The analysis uses publicly available datasets to explore crime patterns, detect anomalies, and build predictive models.

We employ descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, regression models, clustering, and time-series forecasting (ARIMA/SARIMA) to uncover trends and potential factors influencing crime rates.

# Datasets Used 📂

We utilized multiple datasets from publicly available sources:

US Crime Dataset (Kaggle) – National crime statistics.
NYPD Arrest Data (Data.gov) – Arrest records for New York City.
New Jersey Crime Data – Crime data for New Jersey.
State Crime Dataset (Corgis-edu) – Crime statistics aggregated by state.
Project Workflow 🔄

# Our analysis is divided into the following phases:

📌 Phase 1: Nationwide Crime Analysis
Descriptive statistics to summarize crime trends across the U.S.
Time series analysis to identify patterns.
Comparative analysis using ANOVA & t-tests.
📌 Phase 2: NY & NJ Focused Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying crime hotspots using geospatial visualizations.
Hypothesis Testing: Comparing crime rates between NY, NJ, and national trends.
Regression Modeling: Analyzing key socio-economic factors affecting crime rates.
📌 Phase 3: Predictive & Statistical Modeling
Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA/SARIMA.
Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) to identify high-risk areas.
Correlation Analysis: Studying the impact of unemployment, poverty, and inflation on crime rates.
📌 Phase 4: Data Visualization & Insights
Interactive dashboards (Tableau, Python - Seaborn/Matplotlib).
Geospatial crime density maps for NY & NJ.
Policy recommendations based on statistical insights.
